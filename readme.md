# Web Components Experiments

This is a repo for experimenting with web components. Once these become a thing, I'll spin up a new repo with a way more legit name.

The master branch in this repo contains 'vanilla' web components. The only production dependency for these components are the polyfills and shims necessary for full browser support.

The 'lit-element' branch contains web components with the boilerplate removed. It's possible we'd go with LitElement to streamline our components but it's also possible that we'd decide to write some of our own helpers.
